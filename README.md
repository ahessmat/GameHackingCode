# About

This is a forked repo of the exercises for [Game Hacking: Developing Autonomous Bots for Online Games](http://www.nostarch.com/gamehacking). The original repo can be found here:

[https://github.com/GameHackingBook/GameHackingCode](https://github.com/GameHackingBook/GameHackingCode)

I found that the provided exercises and setup instructions were outdated/deprecated, leading to a lot of frustration in simply getting things setup/going out-of-the-box. Moreover, the repo appeared long-since abandoned, with no updates having happened in roughly a decade (and no responses to any pull requests or issues).

To simplify things, I collected together all the missing DLLs and dropped them all into one place. Now you can simply run the corresponding exercises without messing about with compilation/runtime issues.

**NOTE**: this fix worked on a Windows 10 VM as of 2 May 2025
